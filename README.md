# Endless-Sky-Star-Wars-Edition
Just a plugin that I made that aims to replicate Star Wars (or at least tries to) in Endless Sky.

An important note: I have no intentions of completing the project, but I thought I might as well make it available for other people. If anybody would like to update the plugin for themselves, please feel free! I have no idea how Github works, so maybe duplicate the plugin into your own repositories so that I don't have to deal with any of the "pull request" stuff.

Currently, the plugin is unbalanced, buggy and overall frustrating at times, and I honestly don't know if any of these issues will ever be solved. If you want, try to find resolutions to these problems, and most importantly, remember to have fun! (also please don't bombard me with questions)
