# Endless Sky – A Galaxy Far Far Away (AGFFA)
A Galaxy Far Far Away (AGFFA) is an experimental plugin that brings the Star Wars franchise to Endless Sky (or at least tries to). Adding hundreds of ships, ranging from one-man starfighters to star destroyers or even star dreadnoughts, the plugin encompasses ships from a variety of eras and factions (The Old Republic, the Republic & CIS, the Empire & Rebels, the First Order & Resistance, and even some from Legends).

Currently, the plugin is highly unbalanced, has no existing storyline, has an incomplete galaxy, and is just a fun side project that I occasionally mess around with in my free time.

### An important note:
I really don't know if this project will ever be completed (it's not a high priority for me), but I thought I might as well make it available for other people. If anybody would like to update the plugin for themselves, please feel free! I have no idea how Github works, so maybe duplicate the plugin into your own repositories so that I don't have to deal with any of the "pull request" stuff.

Currently, the plugin is unbalanced, buggy and overall frustrating at times, and I honestly don't know if any of these issues will ever be solved. (also please don't bombard me with questions)

### Known Issues:
1) The maximum number of turrets that a ship can have is 32, limiting the capital ships' abilities to fight
2) Starfighter AI struggle to deploy proton bombs properly due to their high drags
3) Similar to vanilla Endless Sky, starfighters can die far too easily
4) I have created both "Starfighter" and "Starfighter (Bay)" versions of each starfighter so that some may be docked while some cannot. This is less than ideal, but works alright
5) Ship balancing in general is pretty terrible at the moment (it's really quite difficult to follow SW lore)
6) Some computers are unable to load AGFFA due to the plugin's absurdly large file size

### Limitations:
1) The galaxy map is barely complete (only a few systems have been filled, though all of them have been created)
2) I didn't know whether to set the plugin in the Galactic Republic era, the Imperial era, or the New Republic/First Order era. (I added ships from all eras just in case –> including the Old Republic)
3) Outfits & weapons are currently just placeholders since I tried to standardise them just to make it easier for balancing.
4) Missions are currently non-existent (though I have added a few simply for the purposes of making some videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-_KH3Umhe4)
5) Fleets are also essentially non-existent, though there are a couple around.
6) I'm running out of things to say, but I'm sure some other problems will be discovered at some point.

### Adding ships:
The "images/ship" folder contains many ships that have been yet to be added to the plugin. If you wish to add them to the game, follow the steps below:
1) Scale the png. file down to a size that is comparable to the rest of the other ships (just estimate)
2) Use the website (endless-sky.github.io/ship_builder.html) to place engines, turrets and guns.
   Use the "Show Collision Mask" to identify any semi-transparent pixels
3) Add the ship to the corresponding txt. file in the "data" folder, including the correct outfits and hardpoints.
   - For the description, copy & paste from the wookiepedia entry of the ship.
4) Add the ship name to the "data/sales" txt. file.
5) Finished!
