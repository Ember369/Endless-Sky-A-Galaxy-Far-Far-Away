Following the Mandalorian Crusaders' conquest of Basilisk in 4017 BBY, the Mandalorian warriors pillaged the powerful war droids for themselves. To the Mandalorians, the Basilisk droid was known as the Bes'uliik—the 'iron beast' in the Mandalorian language of Mando'a—and came to be valued as animal-like companions."

	description "The Cargo Empress-class super freighter was a 110-meter long ship built by Ghtroc Industries. The Cargo Empress was produced shortly after the introduction of the Class 720 freighter and was an attempt to capitalise on the smaller ship's modest success. However, the Cargo Empress sold poorly and was a major contributing factor to Ghtroc's bankruptcy. In a desperate attempt to pay off the company's debts, all remaining Cargo Empress-class ships were dumped on the market at very low prices. As a result, ships of the class could be found throughout the galaxy, despite their commercial failure."

	description "The Gravestone was a massive alien combat frigate that was able to defeat the Eternal Fleet, a fleet of droid-controlled warships that was systematically destroying all life within Wild Space, with its powerful Omnicannon. The Gravestone disappeared after the battle with the fleet, scuttled in the Endless Swamp of the planet Zakuul. Centuries later, it was discovered by the crew of the Outlander, who repaired the starship and used it to escape Zakuul. The Gravestone became the mobile base of the Outlander's group prior to the establishment of the Alliance on Odessen."

	description "The Cygnus Spaceworks Helot-class medium space transport was a transport that was designed in the time before the resurgence of the Empire, that had already declined in popularity by the end of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy. The ship was designed by engineers from both Cygnus Spaceworks and Sienar Fleet Systems, and was designed as an affordable ship. The Helot lacked shields and had low maneuverability, but was equipped with fire-linked laser cannons."

	description "The Inexpugnable-class tactical command ship was a large warship class used by the Republic Navy during the Mandalorian Wars. Designed and manufactured by Rendili Hyperworks and Rendili/Vanjervalis Drive Yards, the Inexpugnable-class was used as a flagship and command ship. Often described as a mobile space station, at 3,100 meters in diameter it was one of the largest Republic spacecraft of its time. The Inexpugnable-class was renowned for its ability to lead massive Republic fleets, employing advanced command techniques such as the Vanjervalis Chain to command up to sixty-four Hammerhead-class cruisers simultaneously. Despite its usefulness as a fleet flagship, the ship had several weaknesses, and as such, only six Inexpugnable-class ships were manufactured."

	description "The KT-400 military droid carrier was a light freighter, and a common sight throughout the galaxy both before and after the Jedi Civil War. Originally designed by Kellenech Technologies, a droid manufacturer, this ship was supposed to carry its military and construction droids. But when it bankrupted, the Galactic Republic took the design and began production of the ships through Republic Fleet Systems. However, after the Great Sith War the funding stopped and a variety of manufacturers was contracted to finish the vessels for military and commercial use."

The design had armour that could extend and retract around the vessel itself. Most models were used around the system Nar Hutta, homeworld of the Hutt species."

	description "The YG-4210, built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, was considered to be an ancient ship model, first constructed more than two centuries prior to the Galactic Civil War, and even predated the venrable YT-series by several decades. Designed specifically for space exploration rather than combat, the freighter was originally unarmed. However, after centuries of serving, most likely none of them matched the original specifications. Weapons such as blasters, ion cannons and concussion missiles were common in these modified vehicles."

	description "The Liberator-class cruiser, also Liberator Cruiser, was a powerful frontline capital ship designed by the SoroSuub Corporation to combat piracy. Although slender and small in size, the cruiser boasted a formidable array of weaponry comprising more than four hundred combined turbolaser and ion cannon batteries, and could carry a complement of six starfighter squadrons and three troop regiments. Utilised by both the Sullustan Home Guard and the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War, the Liberator featured cutting-edge armour plating, shielding, and drive unit technology that made it one of the galaxy's most advanced warships.

	description "The M3-A Scyk fighter was a light interceptor, the lightest of all the starfighter designs produced by its Mandalorian manufacturer, MandalMotors. It was named after the Scyk lizard of Tatooine. Although the Scyk barely provided more amenities to its pilot than a TIE/LN starfighter did, it had two strong points - it was cheap and its weapon mount was designed to handle nearly anything."

	description "The M12-L Kimogila heavy fighter was the heaviest in MandalMotors line of snubfighters. The M12 was used by the Hutt crime organisations to protect their 'interests' and were often crewed by mercenary pilots. Its numerous gun emplacements classified the ship as a heavy fighter, and its torpedo capabilities allowed it to function as a bomber in special circumstances. This flexibility made it quite popular among free mercenaries. Though it lacked the speed and manoeuvring capabilities of its predecessors, its ability to cause wanton slaughter could outweigh these factors."

	description "The Mesens Corporation SCT Scout Craft were long range reconnaissance vessels, commonly used for deep space patrols on the far edges of planetary systems. The vessel's most notable feature, however, was its prominent sensor dish, located beneath the bridge. This was the key component that enabled the Scout Craft to fulfil its function admirably. The craft were not commonly seen, however this was probably due to the predominantly clandestine nature of their missions. Popular with various groups throughout the galaxy, the SCT scout craft was observed in the employ of both legitimate authorities and outlaw groups."

	description "The Hammerhead-class cruiser was a type of warship used by the Republic Navy during the Old Sith Wars, the Mandalorian Wars, and the New Sith Wars. One of the most successful warship designs in galactic history, the Hammerhead-class would still see use in sector defense forces millennia after its introduction and would inspire many later ship designs, such as the Thranta-class corvette and MC140 Scythe-class main battle cruiser."
