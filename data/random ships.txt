	description "Although the class of freighter remains unidentified, once such ship still exists. The Theoretika was a mobile research laboratory owned by Czerka Corporation that was active over a century before the Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Crewed by a team of over fifty engineers, scientists, and researchers, the Theoretika featured advanced medical and scientific facilities on its six decks, and one of the ship's primary projects in its final years of activity was a bioengineered jurgoran specimen labeled Specimen Gamma 19.

	description "The Gravestone was a massive alien combat frigate that was able to defeat the Eternal Fleet, a fleet of droid-controlled warships that was systematically destroying all life within Wild Space, with its powerful Omnicannon. The Gravestone disappeared after the battle with the fleet, scuttled in the Endless Swamp of the planet Zakuul. Centuries later, it was discovered by the crew of the Outlander, who repaired the starship and used it to escape Zakuul. The Gravestone became the mobile base of the Outlander's group prior to the establishment of the Alliance on Odessen."

	description "The Cygnus Spaceworks Helot-class medium space transport was a transport that was designed in the time before the resurgence of the Empire, that had already declined in popularity by the end of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy. The ship was designed by engineers from both Cygnus Spaceworks and Sienar Fleet Systems, and was designed as an affordable ship. The Helot lacked shields and had low maneuverability, but was equipped with fire-linked laser cannons."

	description "The Inexpugnable-class tactical command ship was a large warship class used by the Republic Navy during the Mandalorian Wars. Designed and manufactured by Rendili Hyperworks and Rendili/Vanjervalis Drive Yards, the Inexpugnable-class was used as a flagship and command ship. Often described as a mobile space station, at 3,100 meters in diameter it was one of the largest Republic spacecraft of its time. The Inexpugnable-class was renowned for its ability to lead massive Republic fleets, employing advanced command techniques such as the Vanjervalis Chain to command up to sixty-four Hammerhead-class cruisers simultaneously. Despite its usefulness as a fleet flagship, the ship had several weaknesses, and as such, only six Inexpugnable-class ships were manufactured."

Although not used in large numbers by any governmental organizations, it was not for lack of quality or performance. The Ixiyen was a deadly opponent, capable of holding its own against most of its contemporaries in front-line combat craft."

	description "The BTL-X5 was developed as an effort to extend the effective service life of the venerable BTL-S3 Y-Wing (the 2-seat variant of the Y-Wing).
The BTL-X5 was equipped with a devastating multi-weapon beam, similar to Quarrie's original B-Wing Prototype. The weapon mounts on the sides of the cockpit module were designed so that the blaster cannons could be quickly and easily removed by a maintenance crew and replaced with other large mission-specific weapons such as concussion missiles."
