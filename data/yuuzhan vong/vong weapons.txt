	description "The Yaret-Kor, more commonly known as a plasma cannon, volcano cannon or lava cannon, was the primary intership weapon of the Yuuzhan Vong fleet. As with all other Yuuzhan Vong bio-technology, the Yaret-Kor was an organic creation. The Yaret-Kor operated on a basic principle wherein the cannon took in stone or other massive materials, and then heated the materials up and expelled them towards an opposing ship as a flaming projectile. The size of both cannon and projectile was dependent upon the type of vessel it was linked to."
