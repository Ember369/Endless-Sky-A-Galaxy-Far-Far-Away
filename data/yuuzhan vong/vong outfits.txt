	description "Tall-Yor, more commonly known as Cognition-hoods, are the interfaces that the Yuuzhan Vong use to interact with, and pilot, their ships. Cognition-hoods are not separate organisms, but are actually a part of the vessels they were shaped into, and connect to their pilots through neural cusps. Hoods send information to the pilot in the Yuuzhan Vong, which it usually receives from a yammosk. Hoods are also believed to respond to actions and physical movements that only the Yuuzhan Vong themselves can perform."
