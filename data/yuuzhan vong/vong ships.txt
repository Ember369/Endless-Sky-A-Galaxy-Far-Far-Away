	description "The Yorik-et, referred to as a coralskipper or skip by New Republic forces, is the Yuuzhan Vong version of a starfighter. The Yorik-et is a bioship made from yorik coral, since the Yuuzhan Vong despise mechanical technology as an abomination. It is grown instead of manufactured so no two coralskippers look alike. Despite this, every coralskipper share some basic features, such as a dark canopy, and a triangular body."
