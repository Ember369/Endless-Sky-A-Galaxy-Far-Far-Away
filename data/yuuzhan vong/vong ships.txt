	description "The I'Friil Suuk is a heavy interceptor analog, comparable to that of Nebulon B. It is as fast as the Strohna, but much more armoured. Bone-like yorik coral growth plates can be seen starting to grow on the surface of the Suuk, which provides heavy armour from the standard asteroid type rock hull, a trait of Vong ships that is more apparent through genetic mutations in later developed warships."
