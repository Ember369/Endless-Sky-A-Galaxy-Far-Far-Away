	description "The StealthX is smaller than the XJ-series X-wing. It features equipment that hides the craft both visually and tactically, though the craft's position is given away if proton torpedoes are used or if the pilot broadcasts over the commlink. The StealthX is used exclusively by Jedi, as the restrictions on comm usage makes it nearly impossible for anyone other than a Jedi to coordinate with other forces."
