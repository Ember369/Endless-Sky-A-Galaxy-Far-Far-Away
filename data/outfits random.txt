	description "One of the most important systems on any starship were the starship sensor arrays, also called sensor suites. Without sensors, ships would be unable to navigate, spot approaching obstacles, detect incoming ships or projectiles, or chart interstellar phenomena. Sensor arrays gathered information about the surrounding space or environment using a variety of sensors and then an advanced computer would process and analyse the data for the crew to use."
