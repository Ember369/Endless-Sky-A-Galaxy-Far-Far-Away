	description "The MC80B Star Cruiser is a Mon Calamari warship produced for the fledgling New Republic fleet. The MC80B has a roughly similar look to earlier models, but has optimised the amount of guns available for a frontal assault by positioning them in forward-facing clusters around the ship. The class has its main reactor located on the ventral side of the vessel, while its bridge is located on the dorsal side, amidship. Hangar bays are located on the flanks of the ship."

	description "The Starhawk-class Battleship Mark I is a type of battleship in service with the New Republic Defense Fleet. Like all the ships constructed at the Nadiri Dockyards, they have been constructed from disassembled captured Imperial spacecraft. It is notable for being one of the first class of ships built by the New Republic, through military contract, after the Battle of Endor."

	description "The Viscount-class Star Defender was envisioned as the New Republic equivalent of an Executor-class Star Dreadnought. The first prototype was a 3 km long battlecruiser, and the full production model was a 17 km long dreadnought. Although slightly shorter in length than the Executor-class, the superior construction skills of the Mon Calamari have enabled the vessel to carry more starfighters, as well as having a substantially smaller crew. Its shape is also more compact than the Executor-class and it has heavier and more extensive armour. Dozens of docking clamps allow the vessel to directly dock with many other capital ships at the same time."
