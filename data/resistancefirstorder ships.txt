The BTA-NR2 Y-wing was marketed as "the starfighter that broke the Empire's back" and was sold to the New Republic, all while keeping in line with treaty restrictions. With the rise of the First Order, however, the Resistance was created to counter it and obtained BTA-NR2 Y-wings, modifying them past prohibitions to be more effective."
