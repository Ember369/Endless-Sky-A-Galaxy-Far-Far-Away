	description "The Golan Space Defence SpaceGun, also known as the Golan I, is the first space station in Golan Arms' series of space defence platforms. First built during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the Golan I is used to defend small planetary outposts and space facilities such as shipyards. Although they have been largely succeeded by the Golan II Space Defense SpaceGun, the Golan I remains deadly to starfighters and small capital ships."
