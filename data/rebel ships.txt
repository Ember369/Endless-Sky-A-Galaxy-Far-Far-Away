	description "Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate served in a range of capacities, although was typically utilized as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deployed these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some were modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "Though it shared a similar profile with its predecessor, the Nebulon-B2 differed in some key ways. The forward pod split into an inverted-V shape which allowed for greater surface area to mount weaponry; furthermore the connecting spar was heavier, rendering it less vulnerable to being split open by heavy fire, and the ship was about 50 meters shorter overall."
