Like its successors, the vessel featured a gyroscopic cockpit, twin S-foils with wingtip-mounted laser cannons, cannons mounted at the tail and cockpit chin, warhead launchers, and a hyperdrive."

	description "The Assault Frigate Mark II is a class of frigate that is heavily modified and retrofitted from the Republic Era Dreadnought-class heavy cruiser manufactured by Rendili StarDrive. The large number of modifications lowers the number of personnel needed to operate the vessel, and it also improves the starship's manoeuvrability and speed while maintaining the original Dreadnought-class's considerable amount of firepower. Assault Frigates serve as command ships for Alliance forces in isolated sectors in the Outer Rim Territories, while others themselves serve as escorts for larger command vessels."

	description "The CC-7700 frigate is a class of frigate used by the Imperial Navy, an updated version of the earlier Detainer CC-2200. The CC-7700 is an Interdictor vessel, due to its ability to emit an interdiction field, which prevents other ships from entering hyperspace and can be used to maroon vessels traveling at lightspeed. The CC-7700 is lightly armed and is not intended to act as a battleship. Instead, it is designed to be a platform for gravity well projectors with a mission profile similar to the Immobiliser 418 Cruiser."

	description "The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship is one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and is the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it is fast and carries heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class. Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship has minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships are designed to be only two things: fast and deadly."

	description "The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship is one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and is the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it is fast and carries heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class. Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship has minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships are designed to be only two things: fast and deadly."

	description "The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Despite being intended for Imperial Navy service, it is more famous for its role as a Rebel Cruiser, used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate serves in a range of capacities, although is typically utilised as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deploys these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some are modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "Though it shares a similar profile with its predecessor, the Nebulon-B2 differs in some key ways. The forward pod split into an inverted-V shape, allowing for greater surface area to mount weaponry. Furthermore, the connecting spar is heavier, rendering it less vulnerable to being split open by heavy fire. The ship is about 50 meters shorter overall."

	description "The MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser is an early type of Mon Calamari Star Cruiser put into service for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Like most Mon Calamari designs, each vessel is individually unique, something that is frustrating for Rebel technicians. As with other Calamari designs during the Galactic Civil War, all warships in this group have been standardised as much as possible to aid non-Calamari crewmembers, something the artistic Mon Calamari have accepted begrudgingly."

	description "The MC80B Star Cruiser is a Mon Calamari warship produced for the fledgling New Republic fleet. The MC80B has a roughly similar look to earlier models, but has optimised the amount of guns available for a frontal assault by positioning them in forward-facing clusters around the ship. The class has its main reactor located on the ventral side of the vessel, while its bridge is located on the dorsal side, amidship. Hangar bays are located on the flanks of the ship."

	description "The RZ-1 A-wing interceptor, also known as the A-wing, is a wedge-shaped starfighter manufactured by Kuat Systems Engineering. Taking design inspiration from the Republic starfighters of the Clone Wars, the interceptor was primarily based on the original R-22 prototype. Early rebel movements have adopted the fighter against the Galactic Empire, using them extensively during operations. Essentially a cockpit with two engines, the RZ-1 is so fast and manoeuvrable that it is a challenge to pilot even for even the most experienced pilots."
