The Rebel Alliance deployed these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some were modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "Though it shared a similar profile with its predecessor, the Nebulon-B2 differed in some key ways. The forward pod split into an inverted-V shape which allowed for greater surface area to mount weaponry; furthermore the connecting spar was heavier, rendering it less vulnerable to being split open by heavy fire, and the ship was about 50 meters shorter overall."

	description "The MC30c frigate was a class of Mon Calamari-designed warship, utilised by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Considered one of the most powerful mid-level frigates used in the war, the MC30c frigates utilised proton torpedoes as well as turbolaser batteries to bombard larger enemy starships in combat. In addition to this, it was also one of the fastest ships of its type. (8 Fighters)"

	description "The Starhawk-class Battleship Mark I was a type of battleship in service with the New Republic Defense Fleet. Like all the ships constructed at the Nadiri Dockyards, they were constructed from disassembled captured Imperial spacecraft. It was notable for being one of the first class of ships built by the New Republic, through military contract, after the Battle of Endor."
