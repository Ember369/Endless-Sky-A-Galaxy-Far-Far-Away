	description "The Allegiance-class battlecruiser was similar in appearance to both the Victory, Procursator and Imperial-class Star Destroyers, but was larger than all of them, reaching a length of 2,200 meters. Unlike the Victory and the Imperial, the Allegiance-class lacked ventral hangar bays. Like fellow hangarless models such as the Procursator and Tector-class, the model could seemingly only rely on its own exterior ordnance, as the Allegiance appeared to be unable to carry any starfighters or ground vehicles internally.

The Assertor-class Star Dreadnought was 15 kilometers long and had a hull-shape similar to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought, being primarily shaped like an arrowhead. It was considered the second largest of the standard Star Dreadnought line (with only the Executor-class being larger), as well as the largest in the Imperial Navy in a family that included the Mandator- and Bellator-class ships.

	description "The Bellator-class dreadnought was a warship in the Imperial Navy, as well as a divergent design in the Mandator-series of Star Dreadnought. During the class's service period, several Bellator-class dreadnoughts were known to have docked at Naval Station Validusia for refueling and maintenance alongside other heavy warships. In addition, ships of both this class and that of its cousin, the Mandator-class, often flanked the Assertor-class Star Dreadnought in fleet formations during the Galactic Civil War since prior to the Battle of Yavin, largely due to that ship's role as a sector command and control ship. (Fighters 140)"

	description "The Incom Corporation I-7 Howlrunner was a short range attack starfighter employed by the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. The Howlrunner was constructed around an aerodynamic fixed-wing structure. Two fins jutted out of the sides of the craft, meant to function as rudimentary maneuvering flaps. Though this design was rather simple it gave the Howlrunner superior performance to the TIE/LN starfighter in both space and atmosphere. The controls had a small learning curve, ensuring that nearly any pilot with basic skills could control the craft—although only the most experienced could discover the true power of this starfighter."

	description "The IPV-1 System Patrol Craft, also known as the Imperial patrol vessel,[4] Imperial patrol vehicle or IPV-1-class corvette, was a standard system security and customs vessel commonly used near planets to interdict smugglers and protect against piracy. It was produced by Republic Sienar Systems. Being very fast and manoeuvrable, they patrolled Republic and later Imperial sectors when larger ships were unavailable. They were regarded as the first line of defence against purveyors of contraband and various organisations attempting insurrection against a system, and relied on their speed to catch and disable or destroy enemy craft."

	description  "The Strike-class medium cruiser was a medium star cruiser designed by the Loronar Corporation during the Galactic Civil War for the Imperial Navy as a general-purpose vessel capable of modular modifications to allow it to fit many mission profiles, yet cheap enough to be produced in large quantities. A departure from the Navy's trend towards increasingly large warships, the Strike-class cruiser was an admission to diminished ability to defend space superiority against the Rebel Alliance and other forces as the conflict wore on.
