	description "The Omnicannon was a powerful weapon that was the primary weapon of the Gravestone, an ancient and alien combat frigate. Through the Omnicannon, the Gravestone was the only starship capable of battling the Eternal Fleet; the Omnicannon fired shots that propagated outward after hitting from its primary target, spreading damage to nearby ships. The Outlander's group's first use of the Omnicannon took out two dozen ships in a single shot."
