Though newer scouts existed, this model remains popular thanks to its good speed and manoeuvrability for its class. It is one of the few ships that can slip past a blockade without being noticed, and so is sometimes used to get important people off blockaded planets."

	description "As they became known for their light weaponry, more and more transports were attacked and captured by pirate gangs, especially those smuggling valuable cargo for Black Sun. To counter this threat to its profits, Black Sun decided to modify some of their cargo transports into heavily defended gunships that would act as escorts for the rest of their convoys."

	description "The Bothan frigate was a warship deployed by the Bothans for use by the Confederation Fleet. It is still produced by the Tallaani Shipyards. Despite an early attempt at maintaining fleets of larger capital ships, like the venerable Bothan Assault Cruiser, the Bothan government opted in the aftermath of the Battle of Gilatter VIII to maintain a larger fleet of small, agile vessels. The result was the Tallani-built Bothan frigate, which was noted for heavier than normal armour plating and an impressive array of weaponry."

	description "The Crusader corvette is a warship produced by Mandal Hypernautics. Named after the ancient Mandalorian Crusaders, the corvette is similar in appearance to the Kandosii-type dreadnaught of earlier millennia, complete with sharp edges marking the superstructure. The corvette is faster than any other similar ship, an attribute along with its large weapons-complement, makes the Crusader an extremely pricey vessel."

The D-type has better acceleration and manoeuvrability than most Human-designed starfighters since Yevethans can physically tolerate more g-force and have an edge in inertial dampening technology. It is very effective in atmosphere, but it had no weapons capable of harming shielded capital ships."

	description "The D-type starfighter is a starfighter built by the Yevetha, an alien race living in the Koornacht Cluster. The D-type has better acceleration and manoeuvrability than most Human-designed starfighters since Yevethans can physically tolerate more g-force and have an edge in inertial dampening technology. It is very effective in atmosphere, but it had no weapons capable of harming shielded capital ships."

	description "The Dusty Duck was a light freighter designed by and utilised by Neeamesh Dym, a Pa'lowick smuggler residing on Nar Shaddaa during the Republic Classic era. The craft was notoriously unreliable, would often sputter to a halt in space, and made involuntary and abrupt descents to many barren worlds."

	description "The Dynamic freighter is a light freighter built by a subsidiary of Core Galaxy Systems on the remote Republic world of Transel around the period of the Mandalorian Wars. A stock Dynamic freighter was only modestly armed and shielded; however, the ship was designed to accept modifications without compromising existing systems and most ships were therefore heavily customised by their owners. Though prized for its ability to be modified with ease—a trait advertised by the class's name—Dynamic starships were rare throughout the galaxy as only one ship was produced at a time."

	description "The E-9 explorer is a scout vessel produced by the Loronar Corporation, requiring a small crew to operate at peak efficiency. The E-9 Explorer's armament consists of two laser turrets, one above and one below the ship's main hull. The designers believed this armament would provide sufficient defence, but owners of E-9s have found that the weapon systems are easy to upgrade, often opting to install double, quad, or heavy laser cannons in their stead. Such modifications are viewed by Loronar and the Empire as unnecessary at best, and in some cases deem sufficient cause for the Empire to seize a ship so modified."

	description "The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Despite being intended for Imperial Navy service, it is more famous for its role as a Rebel Cruiser, used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate serves in a range of capacities, although is typically utilised as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deploys these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some are modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "The Cargo Empress super freighter is a 110-meter long ship built by Ghtroc Industries. The Cargo Empress was produced shortly after the introduction of the Class 720 freighter and was an attempt to capitalise on the smaller ship's modest success. However, the Cargo Empress sold poorly and was a major contributing factor to Ghtroc's bankruptcy. In a desperate attempt to pay off the company's debts, all remaining Cargo Empress ships were dumped on the market at very low prices. As a result, ships of the class can be found throughout the galaxy, despite their commercial failure."

	description "The Gravestone was a massive alien combat frigate that was able to defeat the Eternal Fleet, a fleet of droid-controlled warships that was systematically destroying all life within Wild Space, with its powerful Omnicannon. The Gravestone disappeared after the battle with the fleet, scuttled in the Endless Swamp of the planet Zakuul. Centuries later, it was discovered by the crew of the Outlander, who repaired the starship and used it to escape Zakuul. The Gravestone became the mobile base of the Outlander's group prior to the establishment of the Alliance on Odessen."

	description "The Harrower dreadnought, known more infrequently as the Harrower battle cruiser, was a heavily-armed class of wedge-shaped capital ship that was the backbone of the Imperial Navy of the reconstituted Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War, the Cold War, and the Galactic War with the Galactic Republic. Produced by Taerab Starship Manufacturing and measuring around eight hundred meters long with heavily-reinforced hull plating and shield generators, the ship is the inspiration of the Empire's Imperial I Destroyer."

	description "The Heavy Lifter is a spacecraft produced by Patel Ironwerks, significantly larger than the Utility Tug manufactured by the competing Nicholas/Gordon Spacewerks. Commonplace throughout the Galaxy, this craft can be seen towing heavy loads from place to place. The craft has powerful tractor beams that give it the ability to manipulate and haul loads far greater that its own mass. Unlike a Utility Tug, the Heavy Lifter is fitted with a hyperdrive, so it can be used for inter-system ferrying and haulage."

	description "The Cygnus Spaceworks Helot medium space transport is a transport that was designed in the time before the resurgence of the Empire. The ship had already declined in popularity by the end of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy. The ship was designed by engineers from both Cygnus Spaceworks and Sienar Fleet Systems, and was designed as an affordable ship. The Helot lacks shields and had low manoeuvrability, but is equipped with fire-linked laser cannons."

	description "The Inexpugnable tactical command ship was a large warship class used by the Republic Navy during the Mandalorian Wars. Designed and manufactured by Rendili Hyperworks and Rendili/Vanjervalis Drive Yards, the Inexpugnable was used as a flagship and command ship. Often described as a mobile space station, at 3,100 meters in diameter it was one of the largest Republic spacecraft of its time. The Inexpugnable was renowned for its ability to lead massive Republic fleets, employing advanced command techniques such as the Vanjervalis Chain to command up to sixty-four Hammerhead cruisers simultaneously. Despite its usefulness as a fleet flagship, the ship had several weaknesses, and as such, only six Inexpugnable ships were manufactured."

	description "The Invincible Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser, sometimes referred to as the Invincible Heavy Cruiser or Invincible Dreadnaught, is a type of warship that served for many centuries in naval forces around the galaxy. Soon after their development, changes in weapons technology rendered large capital ships like the Invincible extremely vulnerable to small, fast attack ships. For many centuries the balance of military power would rest with smaller warships only a few hundred meters in length. Nevertheless, this class saw some use with the forces of the Galactic Republic, and a number of them were later acquired from Imperial surplus by the Corporate Sector Authority and fielded as picket ships. Advisors hired from system defence navies that still use this and other outdated ships were used to train crews to operate the Invincible as well as do minor systems upgrades to the vessels."

	description "The Kazellis-class light freighter is a freighter manufactured and produced by the Kazellis Corporation. The Kazellis is a sleek and elegant flying wing design that has a number of advanced systems built into the stock model, foremost being an advanced drive system that gives it a sharp edge in speed over other freighters, like the YT-1300. The ship's speed, coupled with other above par systems, like robust shields and a quad laser cannon, make the ship popular with smugglers who want ships that need very few modifications to be immediately useful."

	description "The Liberator cruiser, also Liberator Cruiser, is a powerful frontline capital ship designed by the SoroSuub Corporation to combat piracy. Although slender and small in size, the cruiser boasts a formidable array of weaponry comprising more than four hundred combined turbolaser and ion cannon batteries, and can carry a complement of six starfighter squadrons and three troop regiments. Utilised by both the Sullustan Home Guard and the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War, the Liberator features cutting-edge armour plating, shielding, and drive unit technology, making it one of the galaxy's most advanced warships."

	description "The Muurian transport is a light freighter manufactured by Muurian Interstellar. Designed to compete with CEC's YT-series, the light freighter had speeds comparable to the YT-1300 freighter. While it has a weaker hull and shields than a stock YT-1300, it has a heavier standard armament than the YT-1300 with two double laser cannon turrets, three laser cannons, and two proton torpedo launchers."

	description "The R60 T-wing interceptor was an interceptor originally designed to replace the A-wing. Unfortunately, the end result turned out to be a poor replacement for the craft. Like the A-wing, the T-wing is a light fast-response starfighter. The ship's speed is similar to a TIE Interceptor, but it also includes hyperdrive capability. With shield and hull strength similar to that of the Z-95 Headhunter, this craft would not last long if it was hit accurately by even a medium-power salvo."

	description "The Rihkxyrk (rik-zerk) Assault Fighter is a heavy assault fighter built by TransGalMeg Industries, Incorporated. The Rihkxyrk is a relatively sluggish fighter, but this is compensated for by its good defences and weapons loadout. It is one of the most heavily armed and armoured starfighters designed. The ship is used by the Black Sun organisation as well as other criminal groups. The ship's tight defences has led to many Rihkxyrk pilots having a high sense of confidence in their own abilities as well as that of their ships, after surviving undamaged in many heavy conflicts."

	description "The Mesens Corporation SCT Scout Craft is a long range reconnaissance vessel, commonly used for deep space patrols on the far edges of planetary systems. The vessel's most notable feature, however, is its prominent sensor dish, located beneath the bridge. This is the key component that enabled the Scout Craft to fulfil its function admirably. The craft is not commonly seen, however this was probably due to the predominantly clandestine nature of their missions. Popular with various groups throughout the galaxy, the SCT scout craft is observed in the employ of both legitimate authorities and outlaw groups."

	description "The Starlight-class light freighter is a light freighter produced by Rendili StarDrive in conjunction with Surron StarTech; the last design ever produced by Rendili-Surron. The Starlight-class is designed in the shape of a flying wing, measuring thirty-four meters in length. The cockpit is located at one end of the curved wing, with a turret-mounted blaster cannon mounted on the opposite end. The vessel can carry up to four passengers (not including the one pilot for the crew), and a relatively average quantity of cargo for a ship of its size and class. Its interior is very rugged with limited living space."

	description "The Supa Fighter was manufactured by Joraan Drive Systems for the Black Sun criminal organisation during the height of the New Order. A large fighter with decent armament, the Supa Fighter is slower than an X-wing but more manoeuvrable. Its shields and hull strength are comparable to a Y-wing. The Supa Fighter's hull is mostly symmetrical, but in an unusual feature for a starfighter, the cockpit is offset a few meters to the left of its centreline.

	description "The Supa Fighter was manufactured by Joraan Drive Systems for the Black Sun criminal organisation during the height of the New Order. A large fighter with decent armament, the Supa Fighter is slower than an X-wing but more manoeuvrable. Its shields and hull strength are comparable to a Y-wing. The Supa Fighter's hull is mostly symmetrical, but in an unusual feature for a starfighter, the cockpit is offset a few meters to the left of its centreline. Supa Fighters are most often used to defend Black Sun convoys and respond to attacks on Black Sun-allied facilities. In this regard, they almost completely replaced the StarViper-class attack platform."

	description "The Super Transport XI is a colossal container ship built by Kuat Drive Yards. Their twenty cavernous holds can carry 40,000 standardised containers, for a total of 10 million cubic meters or 25 million metric tons worth of cargo. This great capacity, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of light freighters, makes the Super Transport XI a highly economical means of delivering cargo despite its slow speed. As the gigantic ships are slow, unarmed, and even unshielded, it is suitable only for the safest spacelanes, and requires heavy escort for protection from pirates."

	description "The Venator Destroyer, also known as the Republic attack cruiser, was one of the capital ships used extensively by the Galactic Republic during the later parts of the Clone Wars, as well as by the Galactic Empire. It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards. While designed primarily for ship-to-ship combat, the Venator had secondary roles ranging from starfighter carrier, to military transport and battleship escort. The expanded carrier role made the Venator popular amongst Jedi starfighter aces."

	description "The YG-4210, built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, is considered to be an ancient ship model, first constructed more than two centuries prior to the Galactic Civil War, even predating the venrable YT-series by several decades. Designed specifically for space exploration rather than combat, the freighter was originally unarmed. However, after centuries of serving, most likely none of them match the original specifications. Weapons such as blasters, ion cannons and concussion missiles are common in these modified vehicles."

	description "The YKL-37R Nova Courier was a last ditch foray by Gallofree Yards, Inc. into the realm of light transports, a market nearly dominated by the vast offerings of the Corellian Engineering Corporation. With their medium transport line rapidly developing a poor reputation because of its problems with reliability and maintenance, Gallofree's financial situation spiralled downwards. Gallofree improved the initial medium transport, but it was too little, too late - they had already alienated too many potential buyers."

	description "The YT-2000 transport was designed to be a direct improvement over the YT-1300, but ionly saw a limited production run since its design had been compromised by industrial espionage. Its basic design is similar to the YT-1930 with its centrally-placed cockpit and symmetrical design, while the rest of the ship returned to the saucer-like design of the YT-1300. Due to the turbulent times in which the ship was designed and produced, the YT-2000 boasts heavier standard shields and weapons (two dual laser turrets) than most civilian freighters, certainly than any of its predecessors. The heavy armament and shields, coupled with its speed and manoeuvrability, has caused many Imperial officials to view the YT-2000 with suspicion, especially since the ship has been marketed as a 'civilian' ship."

Favoured by smugglers, the starship features the YT-series trademark saucer-shaped hull and starboard-mounted command pod. Like most Corellian designs, the YT-2400 is fast, tough, and endlessly modifiable. CEC promoted their YT-2400 as having the best features of a YT-1300 light freighter, in a smaller, more compact design. Although YT-2400s aren't as spacious as other YT-series models, they made up for this with their ease of modification and extra cargo space."

	description "The YV-666 light freighter is a Corellian Engineering Corporation light freighter design. The YV-666 is a long, tall, narrow, and blocky freighter with port and starboard manoeuvring fins at the rear that provide vertical movement and a three-deck design. Its propulsion system is simple, though it gives the YV-666 a considerable amount of manoeuvrability despite its size. Considerably larger than the vessels of the YT-series, the YV-666 still bares the ability to be easily modified."

	description "The YV-666 light freighter is a Corellian Engineering Corporation light freighter design. The YV-666 is a long, tall, narrow, and blocky freighter with port and starboard manoeuvring fins at the rear that provide vertical movement and a three-deck design. Its propulsion system is simple, though it gives the YV-666 a considerable amount of manoeuvrability despite its size. Considerably larger than the vessels of the YT-series, the YV-666 still bares the ability to be easily modified."
