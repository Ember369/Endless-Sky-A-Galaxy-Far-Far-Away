Like its successors, the vessel featured a gyroscopic cockpit, twin S-foils with wingtip-mounted laser cannons, cannons mounted at the tail and cockpit chin, warhead launchers, and a hyperdrive."

	description "The Assault Frigate Mark II is a class of frigate that is heavily modified and retrofitted from the Republic Era Dreadnought heavy cruiser manufactured by Rendili StarDrive. The large number of modifications lowers the number of personnel needed to operate the vessel, and it also improves the starship's manoeuvrability and speed while maintaining the original Dreadnought's considerable amount of firepower. Assault Frigates serve as command ships for Alliance forces in isolated sectors in the Outer Rim Territories, while others themselves serve as escorts for larger command vessels."

The Bussard is modular, housing 2 large tanks and several smaller tanks and filtration systems on board. The tanks can all be interconnected, and the front of the ship houses a small refueling rod that can connect to ships in space. It features a door right below the canopy and a ladder along the side."

	description "The BTS-A2 Long-Range Strike Fighter/Bomber (Rebel Alliance designation H-Wing) is manufactured by Koensayr Manufacturing, a company made famous for their rugged Y-Wing starfighters. Because of the resounding success of their previous fighter, it is only a matter of time before the Alliance military chooses to include the H-Wing in their starfighter arsenal. Even so, the number that enter service is expected to remain low, as almost any two single-seated starfighters can be purchased for the same price as a single H-Wing."

	description "The BTS-A2 Long-Range Strike Fighter/Bomber (Rebel Alliance designation H-Wing) is manufactured by Koensayr Manufacturing, a company made famous for their rugged Y-Wing starfighters. Because of the resounding success of their previous fighter, it is only a matter of time before the Alliance military chooses to include the H-Wing in their starfighter arsenal. Even so, the number that enter service is expected to remain low, as almost any two single-seated starfighters can be purchased for the same price as a single H-Wing."

	description "The CC-7700 frigate is a class of frigate used by the Imperial Navy, an updated version of the earlier Detainer CC-2200. The CC-7700 is an Interdictor vessel, due to its ability to emit an interdiction field, which prevents other ships from entering hyperspace and can be used to maroon vessels traveling at lightspeed. The CC-7700 is lightly armed and is not intended to act as a battleship. Instead, it is designed to be a platform for gravity well projectors with a mission profile similar to the Immobiliser 418 Cruiser."

	description "The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship is one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and is the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it is fast and carries heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class. Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship has minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships are designed to be only two things: fast and deadly."

	description "The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship is one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and is the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it is fast and carries heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class. Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship has minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships are designed to be only two things: fast and deadly."

	description "The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Despite being intended for Imperial Navy service, it is more famous for its role as a Rebel Cruiser, used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate serves in a range of capacities, although is typically utilised as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deploys these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some are modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "Though it shares a similar profile with its predecessor, the Nebulon-B2 differs in some key ways. The forward pod split into an inverted-V shape, allowing for greater surface area to mount weaponry. Furthermore, the connecting spar is heavier, rendering it less vulnerable to being split open by heavy fire. The ship is about 50 meters shorter overall."

	description "The Marauder-class corvette is a 195-meter-long light capital ship introduced prior to the Clone Wars. Built by the profitable Sienar Technologies division of Republic Sienar Systems, a precursor to Sienar Fleet Systems, the Marauder-class was intended for use as a patrol and escort ship by the Galactic Republic. When the Republic declined to purchase them, mainly due to the Republic's inefficient bureaucracy and not any problems with the ship itself, Sienar managed to sell some to other small governments and organisations such as the Kathol Republic. Orders were slow, and the Marauder was considered one of Sienar's rare failures, so RSS finally sold production rights to the Corporate Sector Authority to be produced and used in the Corporate Sector."

	description "The MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser, also known as the MC80 Command Cruiser is one of the several MC80 Star Cruiser designs built by the Mon Calamari. Originally fielded before the Galactic Civil War as civilian vessels, they were modified by the Rebel Alliance, and serve in command ship and battleship roles in the Alliance Fleet. No two Mon Calamari ships are identical, each being individually designed and constructed, but they have been gradually standardised by the extensive refitting and adjustments made to the hulls when the vessels were converted for combat duty. Most ships are 1.2km in length, but individual ships can be 1.4km or even longer."

	description "The MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser is an early type of Mon Calamari Star Cruiser put into service for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Like most Mon Calamari designs, each vessel is individually unique, something that is frustrating for Rebel technicians. As with other Calamari designs during the Galactic Civil War, all warships in this group have been standardised as much as possible to aid non-Calamari crewmembers, something the artistic Mon Calamari have accepted begrudgingly."

	description "The R-41 Starchaser is a multi-role starfighter manufactured by Hoersch-Kessel Drive, Inc. The Starchaser was built as a solid starfighter capable of competing with the Z-95 Headhunter, having a good balance of speed, weapons and durability. However,  the Starchaser lacks heavy armour or internal hull bracing, which often makes it vulnerable to well-placed enemy hits. By the end of the Clone Wars, this starfighter was already outmatched by newer starships and by the time of the conflict between the Empire and the Rebellion, it was generally considered outdated."

	description "The X4 Gunship is an assault gunship built by the Incom Corporation and employed by the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire. The X4 was designed by Incom to help fill the critical gap in Alliance forces-a lack of heavy-hitting warships. Used as a convoy escort and raider, the gunship was also designed for maximum compatibility, with most of its equipment capable of using the same spare parts used to maintain the Alliance's starfighter forces."
