As such, it is equipped with weaponry and systems normally reserved for much larger craft. Indeed, the B-wing boasted more firepower than most patrol ships and corvettes."

	description "The Assault Frigate Mark II is a class of frigate that is heavily modified and retrofitted from the Republic Era Dreadnought-class heavy cruiser manufactured by Rendili StarDrive. The large number of modifications lowers the number of personnel needed to operate the vessel, and it also improves the starship's manoeuvrability and speed while maintaining the original Dreadnought-class's considerable amount of firepower. Assault Frigates serve as command ships for Alliance forces in isolated sectors in the Outer Rim Territories, while others themselves serve as escorts for larger command vessels."

	description "The CC-7700 frigate is a class of frigate used by the Imperial Navy, an updated version of the earlier Detainer CC-2200. The CC-7700 is an Interdictor vessel, due to its ability to emit an interdiction field, which prevents other ships from entering hyperspace and can be used to maroon vessels traveling at lightspeed. The CC-7700 is lightly armed and is not intended to act as a battleship. Instead, it is designed to be a platform for gravity well projectors with a mission profile similar to the Immobiliser 418 Cruiser."

	description "The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship is one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and is the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it is fast and carries heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class. Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship has minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships are designed to be only two things: fast and deadly."

	description "The DP20 frigate or Corellian Gunship is one of the few dedicated warship designs produced by Corellian Engineering Corporation, and is the most common member of the Corellian gunship product line. Though small and compact, it is fast and carries heavy firepower for a ship of its size and class. Unlike its cousin, the CR90 corvette, the gunship has minimal cargo space and almost no space for passengers or troops. These small ships are designed to be only two things: fast and deadly."

	description "The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Despite being intended for Imperial Navy service, it is more famous for its role as a Rebel Cruiser, used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate serves in a range of capacities, although is typically utilised as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deploys these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some are modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "Though it shares a similar profile with its predecessor, the Nebulon-B2 differs in some key ways. The forward pod split into an inverted-V shape, allowing for greater surface area to mount weaponry. Furthermore, the connecting spar is heavier, rendering it less vulnerable to being split open by heavy fire. The ship is about 50 meters shorter overall."

	description "The MC80 Home One type Star Cruiser, also known as the MC80 Command Cruiser is one of the several MC80 Star Cruiser designs built by the Mon Calamari. Originally fielded before the Galactic Civil War as civilian vessels, they were modified by the Rebel Alliance, and serve in command ship and battleship roles in the Alliance Fleet. No two Mon Calamari ships are identical, each being individually designed and constructed, but they have been gradually standardised by the extensive refitting and adjustments made to the hulls when the vessels were converted for combat duty. Most ships are 1.2km in length, but individual ships can be 1.4km or even longer."

	description "The MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser is an early type of Mon Calamari Star Cruiser put into service for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Like most Mon Calamari designs, each vessel is individually unique, something that is frustrating for Rebel technicians. As with other Calamari designs during the Galactic Civil War, all warships in this group have been standardised as much as possible to aid non-Calamari crewmembers, something the artistic Mon Calamari have accepted begrudgingly."

Most famously by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War, the ship is renowned for its speed and maneuverability in battle. Acting as the backbone of the Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps, the ship is  both harder hitting and tougher under fire than its main adversary."

	description "The StealthX is smaller than the XJ-series X-wing. It features equipment that hides the craft both visually and tactically, though the craft's position is given away if proton torpedoes are used or if the pilot broadcasts over the commlink. The StealthX is used exclusively by Jedi, as the restrictions on comm usage makes it nearly impossible for anyone other than a Jedi to coordinate with other forces."
