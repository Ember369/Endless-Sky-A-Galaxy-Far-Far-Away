	description "The Galactic Battle Carrier is a capital ship in use by the Galactic Alliance Navy, designed after the end of the Yuuzhan Vong War. Although it is considered a new, large star destroyer, the designation 'battle carrier' was chosen to avoid reminding people of the old imperial terror symbols."

The I4 Ioniser is designed to quickly disable enemy vessels with their ion weaponry. A squadron of Ionisers is capable of disabling small freighters in one pass. Larger targets such as capital ships can suffer extensive damage to key systems if they fall prey to attack runs by Ionisers as well."
