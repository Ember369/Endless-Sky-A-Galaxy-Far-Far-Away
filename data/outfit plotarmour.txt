	description "The MK-series maintenance droid is a repair droid manufactured by Kalibac Industries. The MK-series is designed to be an assistant and occasionally the only mechanic on-board a starship. It has tracked locomotion and an advanced heuristic processor. Kalibac engineers wanted the droid to be able to handle all kinds of situations it might encounter, even new or unexpected ones. They consulted with a wide range of starship engineers, spaceport mechanics and even possibly outlaw techs to make the droid as close as possible to an organic mechanic."
