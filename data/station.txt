	description "The Golan Space Defence SpaceGun, also known as the Golan I, is the first space station in Golan Arms' series of space defence platforms. First built during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the Golan I is used to defend small planetary outposts and space facilities such as shipyards. Although they have been largely succeeded by the Golan II Space Defence SpaceGun, the Golan I remains deadly to starfighters and small capital ships."

	description "The Gun Emplacement is a standard static defence installation produced by Arakyd Industries and used for adding firepower to otherwise defenceless large space stations. Cheaper and more versatile than retrofitting weaponry to an existing station, they require less maintenance and skilled crew than a starfighter squadron. Static defences such as the Gun Emplacement are the sensible choice for budget conscious station commanders wishing to deter all but the most persistent attackers."

A modification of the more basic Large Gun Emplacement (and demanding a similar crew complement), this platform is also designed to augment a space station's existing defence systems, or protect stations and bases that are otherwise defenceless. Unlike its more basic counterpart, the Large Gun/Warhead Emplacement boasts two missile launchers, which although make the emplacement much more dangerous against starfighters and small capital ships, also come at great cost to shield strength and hull integrity."

	description "The Mine Type A, or Mn/T1, is an unmanned static defence weapon produced by the armaments manufacturer Arakyd Industries. A stationary mine armed with an omnidirectional laser cannon, the Mn/T1 is a cost-effective anti-intruder measure. The laser cannon provides defence against starfighters, especially weakly shielded fighters like the Z-95 Headhunter, or completely unshielded craft such as the TIE/LN starfighter, and the contact detonation system is effective against capital ships, especially when the Mn/T1 is deployed in large numbers as a minefield."

	description "The Mine Type B, or Mn/T2, is an unmanned static defence weapon produced by the armaments manufacturer Arakyd Industries. A stationary mine armed with an omnidirectional ion cannon, the Mn/T1 is a cost-effective anti-intruder measure. The ion cannon provides defence against starfighters, and the contact detonation system is effective against capital ships, especially when the Mn/T2 is deployed in large numbers as a minefield."

	description "The Mine Type C, or Mn/T3, is an unmanned static defence weapon produced by the armaments manufacturer Arakyd Industries. A stationary mine armed with an omnidirectional laser cannon, the Mn/T1 is a cost-effective anti-intruder measure. The laser cannon provides defence against starfighters, especially weakly shielded fighters like the Z-95 Headhunter, or completely unshielded craft such as the TIE/LN starfighter, and the contact detonation system is effective against capital ships, especially when the Mn/T1 is deployed in large numbers as a minefield."

	description "The Ion Battery is a static defence weapon developed, manufactured and sold by the Wandrau Arms Corporation. This common, free-floating solar-powered ion cannon weapon platform is an extremely effective defensive weapon. When placed in strategic positions around a space station or other vulnerable target, the Ion Battery is able to provide independent firepower that significantly increases the target's protection."
