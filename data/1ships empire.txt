	description "The Acclamator assault ship, alternatively referred to as the Acclamator trans-galactic military transport ship, was an assault capital ship created for the Galactic Republic by Rothana Heavy Engineering. It was the predecessor of the Star Destroyer line. Its mission profile required it to both carry troops and engage enemy starships: the Acclamator was designed to assault contested systems, break hostile orbital blockades, and land troops directly on the battlefield. Consequently, the Acclamator favoured a wedge or dagger shaped design due to its effectivenessâ€”it allowed concentration of firepower while minimising target profile."

	description "The Allegiance battlecruiser is similar in appearance to both the Victory, Procursator and Imperial Star Destroyers, but is larger than all of them, reaching a length of 2,200 meters. Unlike the Victory and the Imperial, the Allegiance lacks ventral hangar bays. Like fellow hangarless models such as the Procursator and Tector, the model seems to rely on its own exterior ordnance, as the Allegiance was unable to carry any starfighters or ground vehicles internally."

	description  "The Class 546 Cruiser is a model of light cruiser that resembles an Arquitens-class command cruiser of the Galactic Empire. Although similar to the command cruiser model, the Class 546 houses a large internal hangar bay that can be accessed by port and starboard hangar doors and a launch tube at the centre of the vessel between the ship's two prongs. Its bridge is also different from the standard Arquitens-class model, and is equipped with three primary and four secondary sublight engines."

	description  "The Broadside shares a common keel design with the Gladiator Star Destroyer. Designed for long-range engagements, ships of this class have light armour and unimpressive acceleration and manoeuvrability. They are armed with missile launchers and two turbolasers. Early models were armed with expensive diamond boron missiles that could be used to deadly effect against formations of tightly-packed ships. The range of the missiles made them very useful in long-range attacks. These weapons were replaced by more economical concussion missiles in later models, though some of the cruisers still have the lethal armament of their predecessors."

	description "The Carrack light cruiser is a cruiser that was deployed by the Republic Navy throughout the final era of the Galactic Republic and was prominent in the Clone Wars. The Carrack is a cheap replacement for expensive capital ships and is not designed to operate as ships of the line, despite being capable of trading fire with larger adversaries. It remained in use by the Galactic Empire."

	description "The Eclipse dreadnought, also known as the Eclipse Super Star Destroyer, is a class of Imperial Super Star Destroyer manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Like the Sovereign, they are regarded as a new generation of Super Star Destroyer, among the largest dreadnought-scale ships/Super Star Destroyers ever to be fielded within Galactic history. Although technically dwarfed in length by both the Executor Star Dreadnought and the Vengeance, the Eclipse nonetheless exceeds even the Executor in terms of overall mass and volume. Its size is large enough for it to be classified as a space station."

	description "The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Despite being intended for Imperial Navy service, it is more famous for its role as a Rebel Cruiser, used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate serves in a range of capacities, although is typically utilised as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deploys these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some are modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

Fast, heavily-defended, and extremely well armed, the Guardian-class is designed to patrol the remote and hostile systems at the edges of Imperial space unescorted and for prolonged amounts of time. More than capable of handling freight traffic, smugglers, and pirates, the Guardian is not well equipped for large-scale boarding actions as it lacks the space for a sizable boarding party, with crews often opting to simply destroy targets in true Imperial fashion."

	description "The modular taskforce cruiser is a support vessel class built by Tagge Industries Shipyards Limited for the Galactic Empire. These ships function as a generic framework on which Mission Function Modules can be mounted and reconfigured as necessary. The basic design of the modular taskforce cruiser is fairly simple. In its baseline configuration, the ship consists of a command section, a life-support system, quarters for a skeleton crew, and an engineering section. Since this is a support vessel, armament is light for its size. On its own, the baseline configuration does little more than transport a small amount of cargo. The real purpose of this framework us to carry mission-specific modules."

	description "The Neutron Star-class bulk cruiser is a class of capital ship used by the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance, manufactured by Rendili StarDrive. They were designed during the Clone Wars to serve as second-line ships. The Neutron Star-class is 600 meters long. The design has become outdated and easily challenged and outgunned by most up-to-date capital ships. It is slow in comparison with many of its counterparts, and prone to frequent damage."

	description "The Onager-class Star Destroyer, nicknamed the Imperial Siege Breaker by members of the Rebel Alliance, is a type of rare capital ship and superweapon deployed by the Galactic Empire that is shrouded in secrecy. Initially developed to swiftly eradicate Separatist holdouts that remained after the Clone Wars and to bring Core Worlds under the control of the Empire, the Onager utilised kyber crystal-powered superweapons.  These weapons are powerful enough to engage capital ships from extremely long range, as well as conduct cataclysmic assaults on planets."

	description "The Praetor Mark II-class battlecruiser is a warship class that serves in the Imperial Navy. Considered the largest battlecruiser design known, the Praetor Mark II possesses a dagger shape, similar to other prominent warships in the Imperial Navy and is part of the KDY Star Destroyer design family. Few ships of this class were commissioned, as Imperial strategies didn't favour battlecruiser designs. Battlecruisers are regarded as less effective terror weapons than the more massive dreadnoughts. Combined with being more expensive than individual Star Destroyers and less versatile, production on the Praetor Mark II was stopped."

	description "Built in the waning days of the Old Republic and classed as a Star Destroyer during that period, the Proclamator class Star Destroyer had been originally designed as a warship cousin of the Acclamator class assault ship. Unlike the Acclamator, the Proclamator lacked the huge capacity for carrying troops and their supporting equipment, instead focusing on anti-shipping firepower. Overshadowed by the introduction of the Imperator class and lacking the â€˜taintâ€™ of the Republic that saw the Venator class side-lined, the Proclamator continues to see service in the Imperial Navy alongside the Victory and Victory II class ships, fulfilling a similar role to those ships."

Similar in appearance to the Imperial Star Destroyer, the Procursator is slightly shorter, at 1200 meters in length. Much like the Tector and Allegiance vessels, the Procursator lacks a ventral hangar, instead opting for a stronger armour to protect the reactor dome."

During General Rahm Kota's tenure as the owner of the Rogue Shadow, the starship was heavily modified to better suit its role as a Rebel transport. The shielding was strengthened, thus giving the starship a heavier feel when under thrust; other changes included expanded compartments in order to house Kota's squad."

	description "The Secutor-class Star Destroyer is a type of Star Destroyer, carrier, and battlecruiser used by the Galactic Empire. Dating from early in the Imperial Era, the multi-kilometer Secutor is possibly the largest dedicated starfighter carrier in the Imperial Navy. The Secutor-class is commonly used as a command ship or flagship in charge of a task force, often encountered during offensive operations against Rebel Alliance fleets, strongholds, and rebellious worlds. Alternatively, the Star Destroyer can also be used as an escort to larger Star Dreadnoughts."

	description "The Spector Storm Commando Carrier, also known as the Imperial escort carrier, is a type of capital ship used exclusively by the Galactic Empire's storm commandos. Like normal carriers, it is capable of deploying TIE starfighters into battle, including the advanced TIE Hunter, due to its hangar openings on each side of the hull. However, the ship is also capable of engaging in combat on its own account. Ships of this type are used to attack medium-sized craft and transports of the Rebel Alliance, boarding and seizing the Rebel starships and their crew."

Designed to counter the increasing piracy threat during the rise of the New Order, the Star Galleon-class frigate was another Imperial success for Kuat, being capable of transporting cargo without protection. The interior contains sophisticated anti-intruder defences, and was defended by a ship's complement of strormtroopers."

	description  "The Strike medium cruiser is a medium star cruiser designed by the Loronar Corporation during the Galactic Civil War for the Imperial Navy. As a general-purpose vessel capable of modular modifications, the vessel is suitable for many mission profiles, yet cheap enough to be produced in large quantities. A departure from the Navy's trend towards increasingly large warships, the Strike cruiser is an admission to diminished ability to defend space superiority against the Rebel Alliance and other forces as the conflict wore on."

	description "The Tector Star Destroyer was a 1.6km-long dagger-shaped vessel, essentially a version of the contemporary Imperial, with ventral hangars absent. Instead of ventral hangar bays, the design opted for an increase in armour that covered the areas normally used as main hangar openings, as well as the reactor core. This made the design more efficient in ship-to-ship combat, as it had less access to internal weak-spots. However, it limited its usefulness in other roles, requiring dedicated carriers to provide any starfighter support."

	description  "The Ton-Falk-class escort carrier is a transport ship designed to carry Imperial starfighters. Designed and built by Kuat Drive Yards, the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier allowed the Imperial Navy to overcome the hyperdrive deficiency of its primary starfighters in the early years of the Galactic Civil War. Being purpose-built, escort carriers are much more economical to deploy than an Imperial Star Destroyer."

	description "The Tyrant-class Missile Cruiser is a ship primarily built for pacification, suppression and blockading. It's highly sophisticated targeting systems, automation and high firepower make it an outstanding means of defence when there is enough supporting craft to cover it. The ability to create a missile grid is this ship's strongest and most unique feature. The enormous missile ring it carries is capable of a 360 degree field of attack and allows for better precision during bombardment and suppression."

	description "The Venator Destroyer, also known as the Republic attack cruiser, was one of the capital ships used extensively by the Galactic Republic during the later parts of the Clone Wars, as well as by the Galactic Empire. It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards. While designed primarily for ship-to-ship combat, the Venator had secondary roles ranging from starfighter carrier, to military transport and battleship escort. The expanded carrier role made the Venator popular amongst Jedi starfighter aces."

	description "The Victory I Star Destroyer is a warship designed for planetary defence, planetary assault, ground troop support, and ship-to-ship combat. Used by the Galactic Republic during the mid-Clone Wars, the ship continues to see service in the Imperial Navy, though is slowly being phased out by more modern designs. The Victory I-class Star Destroyer's largest disadvantage is its underpowered LF9 ion engines, which can not produce sufficient acceleration to pursue newer and faster ships."

	description "The Victory II Star Destroyer, also known as the Victory II Destroyer, is an improved version of the Victory I Star Destroyer. Though outwardly similar to the Victory I Star Destroyer, the Victory II is designed for deep space combat. The most notable change is the addition of ion cannons, more turbolasers, tractor beam projectors, and the removal of the banks of concussion missile tubes."

	description "The Victory II Star Destroyer, also known as the Victory II Destroyer, is an improved version of the Victory I Star Destroyer. Though outwardly similar to the Victory I Star Destroyer, the Victory II is designed for deep space combat. The most notable change is the addition of ion cannons, more turbolasers, tractor beam projectors, and the removal of the banks of concussion missile tubes."
	description "During the rawmat shortage of 1â€“2 ABY, Imperial Admiral Kendel had one hundred Victory Star Destroyers languishing in dock at Kuat Drive Yards without proper doonium hull plating. In order to clear space at the yards, Kendel ordered the processing of havod metal alloy plates for these vessels. Despite meeting all Imperial Navy specifications, Kendel's decision was criticised by both outside commentators and by crewers scheduled to serve on the red-hulled vessels."
