		description `Naboo is a planet that is the sector capital of the Chommell sector in the Mid Rim, near the border with the Outer Rim Territories. The planet has an unusual plasma core, and its surface is a largely unspoiled world with large plains, swamps and seas.`
		spaceport `	Naboo is a small pastoral world in the Mid Rim, located near the border of the Outer Rim Territories. Unlike most other worlds, the ancient planet lacks a molten core, and instead comprises a conglomerate of large, rocky bodies that make up a network of tunnels and flooded caves. The native Gungans, who built their homes in the waters of Naboo, rarely venture into the core, fearing the ravenous sea beasts which reside in areas such as the Caves of Eleuabad. Despite this, certain Gungan navigators utilize time-honored trade routes through the planet's structure, which serve as the most expedient avenues to reach other areas of the planet. Naboo's interior is rich with plasma, a naturally-occurring energy unique to the planet, and this coupled with its lack of molten core gives Naboo a reputation as an enigma to astrophysicists, who regard the world's structure as an extremely rare phenomenon in the galaxy.`
