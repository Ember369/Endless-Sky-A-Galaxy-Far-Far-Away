	description "The Captor-class heavy munitions cruiser, also known as the Trade Federation heavy munitions cruiser, is a type of commercial freighter-warship that was formerly used by the Trade Federation to transport bacta to buyers throughout the galaxy around 44 BBY. Although built as dedicated warships for the corporation's Trade Defense arm, they are much smaller and less powerful than the Lucrehulk-class. Like many of the Trade Federation's ships, a heavy munitions cruiser depends heavily on automated systems."

	description "The Acclamator-class assault ship, alternatively referred to as the Acclamator-class trans-galactic military transport ship, was an assault-class capital ship created for the Galactic Republic by Rothana Heavy Engineering. It was the predecessor of the Star Destroyer line. Its mission profile required it to both carry troops and engage enemy starships: the Acclamator was designed to assault contested systems, break hostile orbital blockades, and land troops directly on the battlefield. Consequently, the Acclamator favoured a wedge or dagger shaped design due to its effectiveness—it allowed concentration of firepower while minimising target profile."

	description "The JumpMaster 5000, also known as the JM-5000 Jumpmaster Long Range Scout, or colloquially as simply the JM-5K, was a scout ship designed by Corellian Engineering Corporation. Designed during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the JumpMaster was mostly used to scout new hyperspace routes and map newly discovered systems. Indeed, their primary users were the Civilian Astrogation Corps, who used the craft to make sure navigation charts were up to date. That said, due to their speed and powerful sensors, it was not uncommon to find JumpMasters in planetary militias, serving as picket ships and early warning patrol craft."

	description "The Venator-class Destroyer, also known as the Republic attack cruiser, was one of the capital ships used extensively by the Galactic Republic during the later parts of the Clone Wars, as well as by the Galactic Empire. It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards. While designed primarily for ship-to-ship combat, the Venator had secondary roles ranging from starfighter carrier, to military transport and battleship escort. The expanded carrier role made the Venator-class popular amongst Jedi starfighter aces."
