	description "The Captor heavy munitions cruiser, also known as the Trade Federation heavy munitions cruiser, is a type of commercial freighter-warship that was formerly used by the Trade Federation to transport bacta to buyers throughout the galaxy around 44 BBY. Although built as dedicated warships for the corporation's Trade Defence arm, they are much smaller and less powerful than the Lucrehulk. Like many of the Trade Federation's ships, a heavy munitions cruiser depends heavily on automated systems."

	description "The Acclamator assault ship, alternatively referred to as the Acclamator trans-galactic military transport ship, was an assault capital ship created for the Galactic Republic by Rothana Heavy Engineering. It was the predecessor of the Star Destroyer line. Its mission profile required it to both carry troops and engage enemy starships: the Acclamator was designed to assault contested systems, break hostile orbital blockades, and land troops directly on the battlefield. Consequently, the Acclamator favoured a wedge or dagger shaped design due to its effectiveness—it allowed concentration of firepower while minimising target profile."

	description "The JumpMaster 5000, also known as the JM-5000 Jumpmaster Long Range Scout, or colloquially as simply the JM-5K, was a scout ship designed by Corellian Engineering Corporation. Designed during the waning years of the Galactic Republic, the JumpMaster was mostly used to scout new hyperspace routes and map newly discovered systems. Indeed, their primary users were the Civilian Astrogation Corps, who used the craft to make sure navigation charts were up to date. That said, due to their speed and powerful sensors, it was not uncommon to find JumpMasters in planetary militias, serving as picket ships and early warning patrol craft."

	description "The Venator Destroyer, also known as the Republic attack cruiser, was one of the capital ships used extensively by the Galactic Republic during the later parts of the Clone Wars, as well as by the Galactic Empire. It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards. While designed primarily for ship-to-ship combat, the Venator had secondary roles ranging from starfighter carrier, to military transport and battleship escort. The expanded carrier role made the Venator popular amongst Jedi starfighter aces."

	description "The Low Altitude Assault Transport/carrier, known more simply as the LAAT/c, was a vehicle carrier variant of Rothana Heavy Engineering's Low Altitude Assault Transport series of repulsorlift gunships developed for the Grand Army of the Republic. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, the LAAT/c saw use throughout the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems and in the years afterward. Manned by a single pilot, the LAAT/c was originally designed to deploy All Terrain Tactical Enforcers onto battlefields, though it was soon modified to accommodate a number of additional vehicles as the Clone Wars progressed, using powerful magnetic clamps to hold payloads in place."
